jSelectMulti is a jQuery plugin that transforms HTML <select multiple='multiple'> widgets into a user-friendly dual-pannel interface.


It is inspired by a similar Javascript-driven transformation of the HTML widget found in the Django admin application (activated by ModelAdmin.filter_horizontal). 


However, the Django version is unusable for large numbers of <option> elements, and brings the browser to a crawl. jSelectMulti works with thousands of <option> elements.


I have left out any styling, but have classed pretty much everything. See the default settings at the top of jquery.jselectmulti.js for class names. All class names are override-able.


I will provide a sample stylesheet when I get around to writing one.


Enjoy! And feel free to contribute...!
