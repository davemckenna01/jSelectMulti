jSelectMulti is a jQuery plugin that transforms HTML <select multiple='multiple'> widgets into a user-friendly dual pannel interface. It is inspired by a similar Javascript-driven transformation of the HTML widget found in the Django admin application.

However, the Django version is unusable for large numbers of  <option> elements, and brings the browser to a crawl. jSelectMulti works with thousands of <option> elements.
